Crystal partitions generated by the M-S complex are needed by external model learning code such as the generators for ShapeOdds and SharedGP written for MATLAB. A command line argument to auatomatically save these would be helpful and save manual labor since we'd want a crystal partitions file for every design parameter and quantity of interest for a given dataset.

This is the start of such a task, but right now it's lower priority compared to simply generating them by hand by uncommenting the particular line in HDProcessor.cpp.
